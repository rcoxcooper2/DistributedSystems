Contains two python exercises from the python refresher guide


List generator: Create a list of ~10 different integers. Write a function (using modulus and conditionals) to determine if each integer is even or odd. Print to screen each digit followed by the word ‘even’ or ‘odd’ as appropriate.

Prime number: Using nested for loops and if statements, write a program that iterates over every integer from 3 to 100 (inclusive) and prints out the number only if it is a prime number.
